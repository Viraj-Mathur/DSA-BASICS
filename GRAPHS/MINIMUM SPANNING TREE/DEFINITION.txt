SPANNING TREE:  is a subset of Graph , which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges. 
Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected..


Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):

In a weighted graph, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has minimum weight than all other spanning trees of the same graph. In real-world situations, this weight can be measured as distance, congestion, traffic load or any arbitrary value denoted to the edges.
Minimum Spanning-Tree Algorithm

We shall learn about two most important spanning tree algorithms here âˆ’

   -> Kruskal's Algorithm

   -> Prim's Algorithm

Both are greedy algorithms.
